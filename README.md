# Sentiment-Analyser
Customer requirements refer to the specifications or features of a product or service that are deemed necessary by customers. These requirements motivate customers to buy a product or service. To determine customer requirements, companies can research their target market to understand their desires and needs.

WORKING 

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model that can capture context and nuances in language effectively. Below is a step-by-step guide for the working of a BERT-based Sentiment Analyzer:

1. Data Collection:
Gather customer feedback data from various sources, such as customer reviews on the website, social media comments, or surveys.

2. Preprocessing:
Clean the text data. For BERT, tokenization is a crucial step. Use a BERT tokenizer to split text into tokens. Also, handle any specific preprocessing steps required for the data.

3. Loading Pre-trained BERT Model:
Choose a pre-trained BERT model. You can use popular pre-trained models like bert-base-uncased from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

4. Tokenization and Padding:
Tokenize the input text using the BERT tokenizer and ensure that all input sequences have the same length by padding or truncating as needed.

5. Sentiment Prediction:
Pass the tokenized input through the BERT model to obtain the model's predictions.
python
input_ids = torch.tensor(input_ids).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension
outputs = model(input_ids)
logits = outputs.logits

6. Softmax Activation:
Apply a softmax activation function to obtain probabilities for each sentiment class.
Python

7. Selecting Sentiment:
Choose the sentiment class with the highest probability as the predicted sentiment.
python

8. Response and Actions:
Based on the predicted sentiment, trigger appropriate responses or actions.
Positive: Send a thank-you message.
Negative: Create a support ticket for further investigation.
Neutral: Acknowledge the feedback.

9. Monitoring and Reporting:
Continuously monitor the sentiment of customer feedback over time.
Generate reports or dashboards to track trends in sentiment.

10. Model Fine-tuning (Optional):
Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on a domain-specific dataset if needed.

11. Integration with Customer Support:
Integrate the BERT-based sentiment analysis model into the customer support system. Automate the sentiment analysis process upon receiving customer feedback.
